# Spring Boot API with Angular PWA
 
Example app that shows how to create a Spring Boot API and display its data with an Angular PWA that works offline.

To run the server, cd into the `server` folder and run `mvn spring-boot:run`.

To run the client, cd into the `client` folder and run `npm install && ng serve`. Open <http://localhost:4200> to load initial data. Use Chrome Developer Tool to toggle offline in the Network tab and prove that it works offline.
